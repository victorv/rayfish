//! The rayfish daemon: a long-lived, root-owned process that holds the iroh
//! [`Endpoint`], the TUN device, the [`PeerTable`], and the [`ProtocolRouter`],
//! and serves the unprivileged CLI over a Unix-socket IPC channel.
//!
//! # Two lifecycles
//!
//! The daemon deliberately separates two concepts that are easy to conflate:
//!
//! - **Process / infrastructure lifecycle**: the iroh endpoint, IPC socket,
//!   accept loop, blob store, DNS resolver, metrics server, and the TUN *file
//!   descriptor*. These are built once in [`run_daemon`] and live for the whole
//!   process. They are torn down only by the daemon-wide `shutdown_token`
//!   (real shutdown / `IpcMessage::Shutdown`).
//! - **Active VPN state**: the TUN link being *up*, system DNS being
//!   configured, and the saved networks being connected. This is toggled at
//!   runtime by [`Daemon::activate`] / [`Daemon::deactivate`], driven
//!   by the `Up` / `Down` IPC commands, and tracked by [`Daemon::active`].
//!
//! This mirrors Tailscale's split between the always-running `tailscaled`
//! daemon and the `tailscale up` / `tailscale down` client toggles: `down`
//! puts the daemon on *standby* (VPN state torn down) without killing the
//! process, so the next `up` is a cheap, unprivileged IPC call rather than a
//! root service restart.
//!
//! # Cancellation tokens
//!
//! There are two tiers, and the distinction is what makes standby work:
//!
//! - `shutdown_token` (the token passed into [`run_daemon`]) gates all the
//!   always-on infrastructure. Cancelling it stops the **process**. `Down`
//!   never touches it, otherwise the IPC accept loop would die and there would
//!   be nothing left to receive the next `Up`.
//! - Each active network owns a `shutdown_token.child_token()` stored on its
//!   [`NetworkHandle`]. `deactivate` cancels these per-network children to stop
//!   that network's background tasks. Because cancellation is one-shot, every
//!   `activate` mints *fresh* child tokens, so `up → down → up` cycles work.
